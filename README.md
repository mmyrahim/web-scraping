# web-scraping
part 1:

i used splinter and beautifulsoup to automate web browsing and extract titles and preview text from mars news articles, then stored this data in python structures.

part 2:
in the second part, i scraped mars weather data, organized it into a pandas dataframe, and conducted analyses, including determining the number of months on mars, identifying the coldest and warmest months, estimating martian and earth days, and visualizing temperature and pressure data.
